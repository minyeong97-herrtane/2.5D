## Abstract
This project aims to develop an illusion of depth of field with an ordinary display. The idea is to adjust the projection matrix according to the relative position of the eye to the display. This is done by calculating the frustrum the display and the eyes make.
We tested the result with Unity Engine combined with Valve Index VR to track the position of the eye. The idea works, but due to glichy input of the eye and incorrect position input of the display makes it hard to enjoy the changing perspective.
